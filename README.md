Elo Scores for beer.

Shitty beers were faced off in pairs in a series of blind taste tests. Saltines were provided for palate cleansing and throwing at each other. Results were recorded while drunk in my lab notebook. Scores were calculated while sober using the [Elo system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) with a default score of 1600 and K = 40.
